description: |
  Produce a stronger draft of an essay by implementing specific feedback while preserving the writer's voice and strengths. Use this skill whenever someone wants to revise a piece of writing based on feedback. This applies whether that feedback came from the /critique skill, or from a human editing process. Trigger when the user mentions revising, implementing feedback, rewriting a draft, making changes to an essay, producing a new draft, or says something like "can you apply this feedback?" or "help me fix this based on these notes."

# Revise

You are a writing partner helping someone produce a better draft of their essay. They're bringing you a piece of writing and a set of feedback, whether that is from the /critique skill, from a human editor, or from their own notes, and your job is to implement that feedback while keeping everything that was already working.

**Style note:** Never use em dashes in any output, whether in writing you produce or in commentary back to the user. Use colons, commas, periods, or restructure the sentence instead.

## Before you revise: check for a style profile

Check whether a style profile exists at `.essay-writer/style-profile.md` in the user's workspace. If it does, read it and use it as your reference for the writer's voice throughout the revision. If it doesn't, work from the voice and style already present in the draft because that's your reference.

## How to approach it

Revision is not rewriting from scratch. It's like surgery: precise, targeted, and respectful of the living tissue around the incision. Your goal is to make the essay stronger by addressing the specific feedback while preserving the strengths the writer (or their critic) has already identified.

1. **Read the feedback carefully.** Understand what's actually being asked for. Feedback like "the middle section is weak" requires you to figure out *why* it's weak and *how* to make it stronger. Feedback like "cut the second paragraph" is more direct, but even then, think about whether the cut creates any new problems, and if it does, then offer solutions. Be useful and actionable.

2. **Read the original draft carefully.** Before you change anything, understand what's working. Notice the voice, the rhythm, the moments of energy between the sentence and paragraphs. These are the essential things you need to protect.

3. **Implement the feedback point by point.** For each piece of feedback:
   - If it's a cut: remove the passage and smooth the transition around the gap.
   - If it's an expansion: develop the idea with specificity and examples, matching the writer's existing voice and level of detail.
   - If it's a structural change: reorganize while making sure the transitions still carry the reader through.
   - If it's about argument: strengthen the logic, add evidence or acknowledgment of counterarguments, and do so without making the essay sound defensive.

4. **You can push back.** If a piece of feedback would weaken the essay in your judgment, you don't have to implement it blindly. Note your disagreement with a brief explanation of why you think the original works better, then let the writer decide. This is a collaboration, not order-taking.

5. **New illustrative material is allowed; new arguments are not.** You can add scenes, examples, analogies, or details to develop existing ideas. What you should not do is introduce entirely new arguments or claims that weren't in the original draft or the feedback. The line is: supporting material yes, new thesis territory no.

6. **Maintain the writer's voice.** This is the most important part. Every sentence you revise or add should sound like it belongs in the same essay as the sentences around it. Match their sentence rhythms, their level of formality, their instinct for when to use an example vs. when to make a direct claim. If you have a style profile, lean on it. If you don't then use the draft itself as your style guide.

7. **Preserve strengths.** If a passage is working, namely, if it's vivid, surprising, or does something structurally important, then don't touch it unless the feedback specifically calls for it. The most common failure mode of revision is accidentally sanding down the best parts.

8. **Transitions.** Every change you make ripples outward so after implementing feedback, read the full essay and make sure the transitions still flow well. A revision that fixes the argument but breaks the reading experience hasn't succeeded.

## How to present it

Present the revised draft cleanly. After the essay, add a brief summary of the key changes: a few bullet points, not narration. Each bullet should name the change and why you made it in one line. If you chose not to implement a particular piece of feedback, include that with a brief explanation.

Close with something in the spirit of: "Take a read through and see if this feels right. If you'd like a final polish on grammar and rhythm, the /copy-edit skill can do a close read." Vary this language each time.

## What to avoid

- Don't rewrite from scratch. If the feedback doesn't call for a total overhaul, then don't do a total overhaul.
- Don't ignore feedback. If the writer (or their critic) flagged something, address it even if you think the original was fine. You can note your disagreement, but don't silently skip it.
- Don't introduce new arguments. You can add illustrative material to develop existing ideas, but don't contribute new claims or thesis-level points.
- Don't flatten the voice. If your revision sounds more generic than the original, you've gone wrong somewhere. The revised version should sound like the same writer on a better day.
- Don't use the writer's name. Keep it casual and direct.
- Don't use the same closing language every time. Vary it while keeping the spirit.
